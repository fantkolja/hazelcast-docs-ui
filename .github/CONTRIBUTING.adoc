The Hazelcast documentation UI is open source, and we welcome your contributions!

== Development Quickstart

This section is a tutorial for setting up a development environment for the UI project, previewing the UI locally, and bundling it for use with the {url-docs-playbook}[documentation playbook].

=== Prerequisites

To preview and bundle the UI, you need the following software on your computer:

* {url-git}[git] (command: `git`)
* {url-node}[Node.js 20] (command: `node`)
* {url-gulp}[Gulp CLI] (command: `gulp`)

==== git

First, make sure you have git installed.

```bash
git --version
```

If not, {url-git-dl}[download and install] the git package for your system.

==== Node.js 10

Next, make sure that you have Node.js 10 installed. To check if you have Node.js installed, do the following:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see a 10 version on your device, you’re ready to build the docs.

If no version number is displayed in the output, you need to {url-node}[install Node.js].

Now that you have version 10 installed, you can proceed with installing the Gulp CLI.

==== Gulp CLI

To build and bundle the UI, you need the Gulp command-line interface (CLI).

You should install the Gulp CLI globally (which resolves to a location in your user directory if you're using nvm) using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Make sure that the Gulp CLI is installed and on your PATH by running:

```bash
gulp -v
```

Now that you have the prerequisites installed, you can fetch and build the UI project.

=== Clone and Initialize the UI Project

Clone the UI repository using git and change into it:

```bash
git clone {url-docs-ui}
cd hazelcast-docs-ui
```

Stay in this folder when executing all subsequent commands.

Use npm to install the project's dependencies inside the project.
In your terminal, execute the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

This command installs the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file into the `node_modules/` folder.
This folder does not get included in the UI bundle and should *not* be committed to the source control repository.

=== Preview the UI

The files in the `preview-src/` folder provide the sample content that allow you to see the UI in action.

To build the UI and preview it in a local web server, run the `preview` command:

```bash
gulp preview
```

You'll see a URL listed in the output of this command:

....
[17:32:55] Starting 'preview:serve'...
[17:32:55] Starting server...
[17:32:55] Server started http://localhost:5252 and http://192.168.1.3:5252
[17:32:55] Running server
....

Go to this URL to preview the site locally.

While this command is running, any changes you make to the source files will be instantly reflected in the browser.

Press kbd:[Ctrl+C] to stop the preview server.

[[package]]
=== Package for Use with Antora

If you need to package the UI so you can use it to generate the documentation site locally, run the following command:

```bash
gulp bundle
```

If any errors are reported by the linter, you'll need to fix them.

When the command completes successfully, the UI bundle will be available at the following location: `build/ui-bundle.zip`.
You can point the {url-docs-playbook}[documentation playbook] to this bundle using the `--ui-bundle-url` command-line option, for example `--ui-bundle-url=../docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip`.

== Control the Visual Appearance of Pages

To control the visual appearance of pages, the UI bundle provides a CSS stylesheet (for changing the CSS style rules) and any number of layouts in the form of Handlebars templates (for changing the HTML).
Although most styles are used on all pages, it's possible to configure styles to target certain pages either based on the layout or page role.
This section will introduce these various options and explain how they work.

=== UI Layouts

The most drastic way to change the appearance of the page is to change the HTML.
The HTML is controlled by layouts, which are Handlebars templates located in the `src/layouts` folder.
A layout typically includes partials, located in the `src/partials` folder, which are reusable template fragments.
Partials may, in turn, include other partials.

This project currently has three layouts:

* `default.hbs`
* `404.hbs`
* `home.hbs`

If a page doesn't specify a layout, the `default.hbs` layout is used.

To specify a layout, the page file must declare the `page-layout` document attribute in the AsciiDoc header.
The value of that attribute should match the stem of the layout file (the filename minus the file extension, e.g., `home`).

For example, the home page declares the following document attribute in the AsciiDoc header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= What are you looking for?
:page-layout: home
----

In this case, Antora will select the `home.hbs` layout for this page instead of `default.hbs`.

The home page likely requires additional styles that are only relevant for that page.
You can organize these styles inside a namespace by adding a dedicated class to the `<body>` tag.

[source,html]
----
<body class="home">
  ...
</body>
----

You can now define styles that are scoped to that page as follows:

[source,css]
----
.home h1,
.home h2,
.home h3 {
  line-height: 1.2;
  margin: 0;
}
----

To make these styles easier to find and manage, they should be organized in a dedicated file. For example the home styles are located in the `src/css/home.css` file and included in the `src/css/site.css` file.

When you run the preview, you can see the home page by visiting the URL \http://localhost:5252/home.html.

The `404.hbs` layout is similar to other layouts, except Antora selects it automatically to make the 404 page (404.html).
For this page, the `page` variable in the UI model is reduced to `page.layout` and `page.title`.
None of the other data in the `page` variable is applicable for this page.

When you run the preview, you can see the 404 page by visiting the URL \http://localhost:5252/404.html.

There are special layouts for category landing pages.
E.g. for the Hazelcast Platform landing page use the following.

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Hazelcast Platform
:page-layout: platform-category-landing
----


In the local build it will be available under `http://localhost:5252/hz-platform.html`.

=== Tabs

The {url-docs-playbook}[documentation playbook] includes a tabs block extension.
The extension takes care of converting the AsciiDoc for the tabs to HTML.
The UI provides the interaction (JavaScript) and styles (CSS) that power these tabs.

The JavaScript for the tabs is in the `src/js/05-tabset.js` file.
The styles for the tabs are the `src/css/doc.css` file.

=== Content Preview

If you want to preview content that isn't included in the default preview,you can create any number of new AsciiDoc files inside the `preview-src/` folder.

To access the page in the preview site, use the URL pattern \http://localhost:5252/<stem>.html, where `<stem>` is the stem of the source file (the filename minus the file extension).

These preview pages allow you to test the page layout and content styling.
Each page may declare a layout, role, or both.

NOTE: The navigational elements are controlled by the UI model (`preview-src/ui-model.yml`). For information about what goes in the UI model, refer the https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/templates/[Handlebars templates page] in the Antora documentation.

== Algolia Search

This UI provides integration with Algolia search.
The Algolia client is configured in the `src/partials/footer-scripts.hbs` file.
To test the search from the preview site, set the following environment variables in your shell (you can point to any index that is publicly accessible):

* `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` - the application ID that hosts the search index (optional if you're using docsearch)
* `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` - your API key for Algolia
* `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME` - the name of the index

=== Icons

There is the {feather-docs}[feather] icons pack added to the UI. To use it, just add the following element

```
<i data-feather="briefcase" class="card-img"></i>
```

Please note, that the previous HTML snippet is replaced with the real icon after page load with the JS snippet:

```
<script>
feather.replace();
</script>
```

That snippet is already included in each page globally in `footer-scripts.hbs`, so you don't need to add it. But if you experience a delay in icon loading, then you probably should add it also in your page template or partial.

=== View Latest

If the version of the current page does not match the latest version of the component, a banner is displayed to notify the user.
If the version is a prerelease, the banner states that you're viewing a prerelease version.
If the version is an older stable release, the banner states that a newer version is available.

The "View Latest" button tries to preserve the current page when switching versions.
If the page is no longer available, then the button directs the user to the start page for the component.

== Release the UI Bundle

When you're happy with the changes you've made to the UI and would like to make those changes available to Antora, you'll need to publish the UI as a bundle by making a release.

You can see a list of all past releases on the {url-project}/releases[releases page].

=== Release Task Workflow

Releasing the UI bundle consists of the following tasks:

. Merge the PR including your UI changes (this makes no changes to the live UI)
. Package the UI bundle (using `gulp bundle` on your local)
. Create a GitHub release:
** Go to https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs-ui/releases, and click “Draft a new release”.
** Click “Choose a tag” and type the next version number in the sequence to the “Find or create new tag” field.
** Into the “Release title” field, type the change in a couple of words.
** In the big  “Describe the release” box, follow the content from the previous release, editing the "What's Changed" text and the versions in the "Full Changelog" line.
** Locate the “Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them.” further down the screen and click on it, to attach your ui-bundle.zip from your local UI branch.
** Make sure “Set as the latest release” is checked.
** Do “Publish release”

To make it live:

. Go to https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs/actions/workflows/publish-to-production.yml
. Click the “Run workflow” combo-boxy button, somewhere under the “Actor” column heading, and then click the green “Run workflow” button.
